# DIY Haptic Suit Firmware/Softwarte
My custom software/firmware for my DIY haptic suit.

I wont be providing a guide to building one yourself at this time. Too damn lazy, plus, if you can read the code you can make one yourself. It uses VRChat's OSC to do everything, so its a VRChat only setup because I'm only gonna use it for vrc. It's also not all that modular, so if you want to add more, you gotta do it the way I did or re-do it all yourself. Sorry. 

This is less a "Download and use in 5 clicks" thing and more of a "study this code and make your own" thing.

Compatible with pre-existing BHaptics OSC avatars!
